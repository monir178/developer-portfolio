            <p>The success of the books and films has allowed the Harry Potter franchise to expand with numerous
                derivative works, a travelling exhibition that premiered in Chicago in 2009, a studio tour in London
                that opened in 2012, a digital platform on which J. K. Rowling updates the series with new information
                and insight, and a pentalogy of spin-off films premiering in November 2016 with Fantastic Beasts and
                Where to Find Them, among many other developments. Themed attractions, collectively known as The
                Wizarding World of Harry Potter, have been built at several Universal Parks & Resorts amusement parks

                <p>In 1999, Rowling sold the film rights for Harry Potter to Warner Bros. for a reported $1
                    million.[213][214] Rowling had creative control on the film series, observing the filmmaking process
                    of
                    Philosopher's Stone and serving as producer on the two-part Deathly Hallows, alongside David Heyman
                    and
                    David Barron.[215] Rowling demanded the principal cast be kept strictly British, nonetheless
                    allowing
                    for the inclusion of Irish or French and Eastern European actors where characters from the book are
                    specified as such.[216]</p>
